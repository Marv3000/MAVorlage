\chapter{Introduction}
The current research, and it is really great research, it really is. It relies on the theorey -- and I have the best theories, you know, I use the best theories in my research. It really is quite amazing just how great the theory is, but I am not really, in fact -- it is a theory. A really good one and I have talked to people, lots of people actually, and they all think what I said. it has a lot of appeal. It's really just all there and what it is. If people, you know, losers and whatever, if they do not get it, then what are you going to do? It is not like th idea is not there and that, you know, it is what it is. I have to shake my head. Everyone is just shaking their heads. It really is \cite{Trump2016}. \\[0.5cm]
Along with the theory, there is other work. Existing data  -- and again, I have the best data. You would really, if you had the same great data, be completely happy and the data are there. And they are really, you know, data and we have all kinds. The best kinds. And that is what we base the current work, which is great work, that I did and it is great. If other people want to be walked through like babies or something, then I do not know what their problem is. THe data just are there so get off your lazy butts and stop looking for handouts. I am not here to give handouts, you should not expect that. \\[0.5cm]
There are other people who have data that, at least on first glance, and if you believe the haters and losers who want to stop what I am doing. Sure, I could terminate these people, I could like totally ruin their lives, and they would be all \glqq Oh no, what am I going to do\grqq running around flopping around like someone who needs a punch in the face, you know what I am talking about? If you see what they say. I do not know. How can they get away with that? Take a look -- you just take a look at what is going on. I stick up for people when they are right. These other losers need to be fired. I could probably sue them, but that is probably what they want anyway -- to get my attention as if I would bother.\\[0.5cm]
Let me just tell you something, I would love to do it. Absolutely love to drag these people, these liars, these little people with their pretty concerns, but I am standing up for the right thing. That is what I do because that is what I have done and, ask anyone, it is what makes me a great researcher. I would rather write about the issues, the current research, which is much better than what other people have done. It is going to happen.
